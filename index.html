            <p>Before now, getting into the VIP Package cost only $3000. And if you are honest to yourself you will
                agree that this is unbelievably cheap <br> considering everything you get as a VIP member. And now that
                we have even gone the extra mile to bring in industry experts to review your <br>designs personally We
                will have to pay these designers for their time and knownledge. So imagine having a one on one
                mentor/coach, how much <br>would that cost you? 200k, 100k, 50k, etc... <br> <br>But the good thing is
                you are not going to pay even half of any of those numbers. Because this time, you are not paying as an
                individual, rather <br>you're leveraging us as a brand to get yourself a one on one coach. Now, how
                muchdo you think that is worth? 50k, 30k, 20k? <br><br>Well like I said earlie, you're not going to pay
                even have of any of those numbers, <br><br>
